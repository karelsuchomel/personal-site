title: Failing at self-organization

So I'll first admit here that I did failed myself. I did it by not overcoming obstacles I could have overcome. By giving up, when I should have fought.

You have certainly experienced that feeling of hopelessness, when you have an idea, that you want to preserve for later or share it with a colleague, but there is no obvious place to put it in. Upload it to Google Drive? Draw it on paper? In a notebook? Create card in Trello under "ideas" column?
If you feel like this from time to time, you could have come to conclusion that some sort of system could solve your indecisiveness. If there only were a standardized way of doing things, I wouldn't have to think about it. There is no standard for creative process that would accommodate all of the different varieties of our creative processes.

Someone just love to sketch ideas in their notebook... plotting their next designs in peace and quiet. Some like to be more vocal at that. Some like the first opinion only of a selected few.
My take is, don't mess with other peoples creative processes.

# Detesting all the SCRUMS and other abbreviations which stands for something

# Return of investment
Critical point to my argument is that, the tax you pay for integrating many of these tools or behaviors in one's working hours, is many times higher than the return you get back.

To support this claim, I point to the book of Maverick! by Ricardo Semler. It's a story about evolving company rules as young Semler tries to transform the working environment of workers which dislike their managers to a space that is more dignifying for every one.
He evaluates many of the older industry standard way of running a company and asks *why* three times in a row. If the rules doesn't hold up, it probably doesn't do nay good.
Most of the rules removed this way, were in place to create tighter control over workers. To dictate to them, like to little kids, how to do almost everything.

In my life, I've worked with people that take organization super seriously. Tracking their time on each individual project, switching the tracker every time they go for meal, short walk or coffee break. Charting road-maps with deadlines, keeping track of a project on Trello shifting cards left to right and right to left, commenting and assigning cards to others. Why do we do what we do? Don't care, just make sure there are no cards with your name
(best way to do that is usually to make a comment about someone else's job and assign the card to them).

So this is a story about how I wanted more from myself, because I saw all of the potential in my day, because I believed in some kind of optimal system that if followed properly would support me to become more competent in the pursuit of my dreams.

It has always been a struggle for me to recognize where different types of ideas should reside. If I have an idea about cool photo for "about us" page, should sketch on a paper be be suffice or maybe a card on a Trello board in the conveniently named "ideas" column, what about my notebook labeled "IDEAS"? Most of the time, I found myself using the easier of the three. If the idea is too complex to describe with words, I draw a sketch with arrows explaining different parts. When I can capture the thought within couple of sentences, I add it on Trello. This inevitably leads to fragmentation. Loosing grasp of what is where, I sometimes create the representation in Trello and my notebook... sometimes I even mindlessly duplicate the Idea because I am to afraid to loose it.

This has a obvious solution. Just use one place dammit! But which one? Trello boards are so easy to share with others... and collaborate, or at least create the false sense of collaboration and "work being done".
Papers are easiest to create, discard and rearrange, but arguably the worts to present. They are not as concise as Trello cards often changing style of presentation from page to another. 
Notebook has it's own nice package, and because it's not just a paper, I try harder to make the entry more beautiful, with colors and stuff. There is greater sense of permanence. You cannot easily rearrange it (add additional page between two already filled pages, for example).

? I am not making a case against all of those tools, or maybe I am... maybe those tools are just to help us be more lazy and evade difficult questions about why we do what we do. Those are much harder to answer than to tag a card "burning!!!".

? Making organization lists on a piece of paper has the beautiful disadvantage, that you cannot edit it... if you want to create more up to date list, you have to rewrite the new list on a new list of paper. This process forces you to evaluate the importance of every item on that list. Lists should be short and guide you...

? So I only make lists with 3 - 4 items. When I get to 5 territory I raise my guard and think to myself which of these items is not necessary and only product of my wishful thinking.

? maybe the key is to understand how ideas are found in someones head, how they are nurtured to become better, more useful.  

? It's not you... it's the system! Oh ... don't be so sorry for your self you little cry baby. But that is exactly my point, I obviously don't know how to use these tools, or when to use them... so I just use them whenever I feel tey might be useful but they almost never are. The point that I am trying to make is, that todo lists, pomodoro timers and others mentioned are useful only sometimes and that "sometimes" is actually more like almost never. 

? How at the start of the tutorial he says... making game is a hard thing, before you start learning it, make sure your life, your well being is in good condition.

? I've used all these tools mainly for myself, and not to collaborate with others. I've used it to make sense of my creative process... and that is the wrong way to look at this problem... I've come to realize that the tools you use should bent to your process and not your process to those tools. You are than forcing yourself to do things the tool wants you to do... but do you want it?

? Final question could be... does this help me accomplish what I find to be important or is it just a baggage of my carefully wrapped misunderstandings about what is important.

? The biggest Irony is that we enter these little boxes ourselves, and constrain ourselves to everything it brings with it.

? Often times ... or in my case, all the times, these tools, always have some side effect which may or may not affect you, based on what person you are. But as medicine show on the side of it's box, warnings about side effects, so should these productivity tools.
Warning, may disgust you to work on your project! Or, warning, takes 10% of your cognitive load and uses it to make sure, you turn on your tracker when you get back from lunch.
Of course that is not a good marketing, but would be much more truthful. I am always so filled with the false sense of "this tool will finally solve my inability to do this or that"...maybe it will, but it will also make you less productive, because you have to think about using it.
