title: Me failing at self organization
---

Usually including some new revolutionary practice inside my working routine goes through several stages. Chronologically they are

- Excitement and enthusiasm to finally be more productive
- Kinda starting to feel the disadvantages
- Kinda forgetting to use the practice
- seeing that the practice only made me feel more "busy"



Remove all games from your computer, because this way, you will be productive is as to say, I will discard all my chocolate which will make me exercise more.

In this way, maybe just more nuanced, lay the argument, that this or that tool will make me more productive.

I've learned recently about this one interesting youtube-robot-creating woman. She made a kickstarter campaign, to make these LED touch calendars, which you could use to tick off a day in which specified activity was performed. She made a point that she wanted to meditate more, that she never really got around to do that, but this helped her to achieve this goal.
Does it really work this way? Buy this thing that will help you do the stuff you want to be doing but are not really doing for some reason?
I can only reply to this, with "humans are more complex than that". We are guided by "gut feelings", indescribable passions, heartfelt experiences. Calendar like this could help you see all the progress you've already achieved, but if you had problems, this will show on calendar also.

Self organization seems to be needed only when we are not getting desired outcomes. Imagine a world where no one goes over the deadline, and is satisfied with the fruits of their labor. why would you need a timer than, why would you need a card system?

For me, lack of constraining systems means I can mentaly breathe more and concentrate on the stuff that requires my creativity.

To evaluate services that are supposed to help us do more, lets answer the following question three times on each of those and see how they hold up.

To ensure, I am not advsing againt writing things down, that process is absolutely essential to even know what are you thinking. You may know, that when you are putting your mind on paper, you are discovering what exactly are you thinking.
