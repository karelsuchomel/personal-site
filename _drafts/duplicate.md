title: Me failing at self organization
---

To pinpoint what is the subject of this observation more accurately, I am arguing against usefulness of time trackers, task managers (like Trello), rest timers, blue-life-calendars, classic todo-list apps, and other productivity enhancing tips and tricks you can think of. Also, disclaimer! I am writing about something I was never really good at. This fact should serve as a recommendation for you to continue reading these paragraphs with a bit of a distance. I only have my personal experience after all.




So what's the problem here? Let me introduce you to the dreadful process I went though several times already. Call it *realizing-nothing-will-save-me* ... process.



Picture this revolutionary, new project management tool. It's nothing like you have used before. It has all those features your hearth desired. You always know where to look for which information and all the practices that comes with using it, are everyones second nature. It's like an invisible fabric that copies the contours of your team's inner workings so well, you just want to snuggle with it after work.

Now stop imagining it, I have a heartfelt confession for you. In the real world, I have experienced mostly irritation and disappointment working with systems that were supposedly improving my productivity.

I feel that dreaming about such solutions to our difficulties is backwards and that it turns away from how we humans really function.



I won't argue againt road maps or writing things down... this all is part of figuring things out. How long will the feature take to build, what is necessary for minimal viable product deployment. Writing things down, show you what you really think... because you don't really know up until you put it down. You might have a feeling about general direction, but probably lack a comprehensive view of the thing you doing. Many times, we are focusing on the task at hand, day or two into the future.

When it's a figuring things out, why not use some tips on where to start, what questions to answer. They are tho, less of a systems and more of a template that can *inspire* you. Inspire being the important part... not control you.

So there is this hunch of mine, that systems that we deploy in our workplace, we deploy to help us solve issues that the tools cannot help us with, or weren't even designed to.



So I am proposing a distinction in tools and practices we use as a general rules, and those that control us in faith that it will make us more productive.



Remove all games from your computer, because this way, you will be productive is as to say, I will discard all my chocolate which will make me exercise more.

In this way, maybe just more nuanced, lay the argument, that this or that tool will make me more productive.

I've learned recently about this one interesting youtube-robot-creating woman. She made a kickstarter campaign, to make these LED touch calendars, which you could use to tick off a day in which specified activity was performed. She made a point that she wanted to meditate more, that she never really got around to do that, but this helped her to achieve this goal.
Does it really work this way? Buy this thing that will help you do the stuff you want to be doing but are not really doing for some reason?
I can only reply to this, with "humans are more complex than that". We are guided by "gut feelings", indescribable passions, heartfelt experiences. Calendar like this could help you see all the progress you've already achieved, but if you had problems, this will show on calendar also.

Self organization seems to be needed only when we are not getting desired outcomes. Imagine a world where no one goes over the deadline, and is satisfied with the fruits of their labor. why would you need a timer than, why would you need a card system?

For me, lack of constraining systems means I can mentaly breathe more and concentrate on the stuff that requires my creativity.

To evaluate services that are supposed to help us do more, lets answer the following question three times on each of those and see how they hold up.

To ensure, I am not advsing againt writing things down, that process is absolutely essential to even know what are you thinking. You may know, that when you are putting your mind on paper, you are discovering what exactly are you thinking.
