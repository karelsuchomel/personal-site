title: Me failing at self organization
---

To pinpoint what is the subject of this observation more accurately, I am arguing against usefulness of time trackers, task managers (like Trello), rest timers, blue-life-calendars, classic todo-list apps, and other productivity enhancing tips and tricks you can think of. Also, disclaimer! I am writing about something I was never really good at. This fact should serve as a recommendation for you to continue reading these paragraphs with a bit of a distance. I only have my personal experience after all.



So what's the problem here? Let me introduce you to the dreadful process I went though several times already. Call it *realizing-nothing-will-save-me* ... process.


You certainly experienced that feeling of hopelessness, when you have an idea, that you want to preserve for later or share it with the team, but there is no obvious place to put it in. Upload it to Google Drive? Draw it on paper? Create card in Trello under "ideas" column?
If you feel like this from time to time, you could have come to conclusion that some sort of system could solve your indecisiveness. If there only were a standardized way of doing things, I wouldn't have to think about it. There is no standard for creative process that would accommodate all of the different varieties of our creative processes.

Someone just love to sketch ideas in their notebook... plotting their next designs in peace and quiet. Some like to be more vocal at that. Some like the first opinion only of a selected few.
My take is, don't mess with other peoples creative processes.

# Return of investment
Critical point to my argument is that, the tax you pay for integrating many of these tools or behaviors in one's working hours, is many times higher than the return you get back.

To support this claim, I point to the book of Maverick! by Ricardo Semler. It's a story about evolving company rules as young Semler tries to transform the working environment of workers which dislike their managers to a space that is more dignifying for every one.
He evaluates many of the older industry standard way of running a company and asks *why* three times in a row. If the rules doesn't hold up, it probably doesn't do nay good.
Most of the rules removed this way, were in place to create tighter control over workers. To dictate to them, like to little kids, how to do almost everything.




Remove all games from your computer, because this way, you will be productive is as to say, I will discard all my chocolate which will make me exercise more.

In this way, maybe just more nuanced, lay the argument, that this or that tool will make me more productive.

I've learned recently about this one interesting youtube-robot-creating woman. She made a kickstarter campaign, to make these LED touch calendars, which you could use to tick off a day in which specified activity was performed. She made a point that she wanted to meditate more, that she never really got around to do that, but this helped her to achieve this goal.
Does it really work this way? Buy this thing that will help you do the stuff you want to be doing but are not really doing for some reason?
I can only reply to this, with "humans are more complex than that". We are guided by "gut feelings", indescribable passions, heartfelt experiences. Calendar like this could help you see all the progress you've already achieved, but if you had problems, this will show on calendar also.

Self organization seems to be needed only when we are not getting desired outcomes. Imagine a world where no one goes over the deadline, and is satisfied with the fruits of their labor. why would you need a timer than, why would you need a card system?

For me, lack of constraining systems means I can mentaly breathe more and concentrate on the stuff that requires my creativity.

To evaluate services that are supposed to help us do more, lets answer the following question three times on each of those and see how they hold up.

To ensure, I am not advsing againt writing things down, that process is absolutely essential to even know what are you thinking. You may know, that when you are putting your mind on paper, you are discovering what exactly are you thinking.
